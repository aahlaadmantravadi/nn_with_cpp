Under some MASSIVE refactoring, renovation and re-purposing (Re-upload of repository). Only public currently for ease of access during development.

Wouldn't recommend running but it works somewhat if you have :
1) Visual Studio 2022. (Options to choose - Desktop development with C++ with MSVC build tools, C++ CMake tools for Windows, Windows SDK)
2) CUDA Toolkit. (Options to choose - Default, install after Visual Studio and make sure Visual Studio Integration options are checked)

Internet access is required while running as vcpkg, CMake and other tools are downloaded and installed while building.
